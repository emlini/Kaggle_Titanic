# Kaggle_Titanic
Notes on working through the analysis of survival for the Titanic data set from Kaggle 

Working in R Studio

# Goal: Develop a model to predict whether a person would have survived the sinking of the Titanic (determine the factors that, in combination, contributed to survival)

# STEP 1: SETUP

### libraries imported
library(ggplot2)  //for data visualization

library(dplyr)    //set of data manipulation functions

library(nlme)   //linear modeling package (MAY NOT NEED THIS)

library(readxl)  //has "subset" function that allows you to generate subset table for rows that have given value in a specific column

### figured out working directory using gwtwd()
### set working directory using setwd()
